# Portfolio Website with Next.js 13 App Router, React 18, SCSS, and tortaCMS

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project showcases my skills and experience as a developer using the latest technologies. In this portfolio, I've utilized Next.js 13, React 18, SCSS, and integrated it with my very own content management system called tortaCMS, used for managing the blog section of the portfolio.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13**: A powerful framework for building modern web applications with React. It provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing, this website is made with the App Router to bring a seamless user experience.
- **React 18**: The latest version of React that brings improved performance, server side rendering, and much more. It allows for building highly interactive and responsive user interfaces.
- **SCSS (Sass)**: I've used SCSS to style the components in a modular and maintainable way. SCSS extends the capabilities of CSS with variables, nesting, mixins, and more, making the styling process efficient and organized.
- **tortaCMS**: TortaCMS is a content management system that I developed for the purpose of helping developers to bootstrap a blog providing all the backend needed. It's designed to manage blog content efficiently. With tortaCMS, I can easily create, edit, and delete blog posts, manage categories, and integrate with my website with an easy to use API.
